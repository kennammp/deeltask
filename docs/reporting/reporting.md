# Working with reports

This section provides examples in curl and python of how to use the Reporting API to generate reports according to your preferences. You can define time window, granularity, metric, aggregation type, and apply a range of filter dimensions. 

When creating a report you will:

 - Define the time window.
 - Specify granularity, which is the time interval between data points.
 - Define your filters with the ``dimensions`` object, and the ``dimension_filter_clauses`` object which will contain an array of ``filter`` objects.
 - Request metrics such as connections, time usage, and data usage with the ``metrics`` object.
 - Use ``aggregation_type`` to choose which data within the raw report data you want to see.

The example scripts in this section give a response in json format, however you can get responses in csv format with ``--header 'Accept: text/csv'``.

## Time windows

Some of the reports below require you to specify the time window over which to run the report.

The time window is set with ``start_date_time`` and ``end_date_time``. You can either specify actual times and dates, in the format ``YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss``, or request a set time block with ``LAST HOUR``, ``LAST DAY``, ``LAST WEEK``, ``LAST MONTH`` or ``NOW`` (returns the last 5 minutes). 

If you are requesting a set time block, this must be configured in both ``start_date_time`` and ``end_date_time``, for example:

```bash
"start_date_time": "LAST HOUR",
"end_date_time": "LAST HOUR",
```

You can also specify the data point frequency in your report with the ``granularity`` parameter, which can be ``HOUR`` or ``DAY`` (default is ``HOUR``).


## Dimensions and metrics

As mentioned above, you will request a report ``metric``, and filter it with ``dimensions``. Our reports are grouped into mobile device or 'UE' reports, and Edge Point reports. Refer to the [**Mobile Device (UE) Reports**](uereports) and [**Edge Point Reports**](epreports) sections for more details.

## Aggregation types

A report will gather many data points, and you decide which specific data you are interested in by defining the ``aggregation_type``. This may be a single data point, such as ``MAX`` or ``MIN``, or a calculation derived from multiple data points, such as ``AVG``.

Supported aggregation types are:
 - ``EXISTS`` (for status reports)
 - ``COUNT`` (sum of data points)
 - ``MAX`` 
 - ``MIN``
 - ``AVG`` 

Different ``metrics`` support different ``aggregation_types``:

**``ue_online_status``:** 
  - ``EXISTS``

**``ue_connections``:**
 - ``COUNT`` 
 - ``MAX`` 
 - ``AVG``

**All other metrics:**
 - ``COUNT``
 - ``MAX``
 - ``MIN``
 - ``AVG``

## Bandwidth calculation

:::note
Bandwidth values are displayed in Mbps down to 2 decimal places. Values below 0.01 Mbps are rounded up or down accordingly, such that any value >=0.005 Mbps will be rounded up to 0.01 Mbps, and anything <0.005 Mbps will be rounded down to zero.
:::

### Average bandwidth

During a time period (as specified by the `granularity` parameter), we count:

- Each second during which traffic was seen during the time period
- Total traffic seen during that time period. 

To calculate the average bandwidth during the time period, we divide the *total traffic* seen during the time period (in bytes) by the *number of seconds during which traffic was seen*, and provide this value in megabits per second.

>  ***For example:***
>
> Time period (`granularity`) 1 hour <br/>
> Traffic direction: Uplink
> 
> During the hour we counted:
> 
> - 1750 seconds during which traffic was seen
> - A total traffic of 25900000 bytes 
> 
> Therefore the average bandwidth for that hour will be calculated thus:
> 
> 25900000 / 1750 = 14800 bytes per second <br/>
> 14800 bytes per second = 0.1184 megabits per second.
> 
> As we round up to 2 decimal places, the average uplink bandwidth for that hour will be shown as: **0.12 megabits per second**
>

### Maximum bandwidth

The specified time period (eg. 1 hour) is split into 5 minute windows, and we record the highest throughput per second seen during each 5 minute window. Once the time period has elapsed, the highest throughput recorded is displayed in Mbps as the maximum bandwidth for the time period.

### Minimum bandwidth

The specified time period (eg. 1 hour) is split into 5 minute windows, and we record the lowest throughput per second seen during each 5 minute window. Once the time period has elapsed, the lowest throughput  is displayed in Mbps as the minimum bandwidth for the time period. If there is a 5 minute window during which no traffic is seen, minimum bandwidth for the time period will be zero.
